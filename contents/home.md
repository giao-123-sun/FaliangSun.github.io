A leading voice in industrial digital transformation and a key contributor to China's national standards for **Digital Twin (GB/T 41723)** and **Digital Handover (GB/T 51296)**. Currently serving as the Chief Product Officer at Chicheng, I bring over 25 years of experience in architecting and delivering high-value solutions across the process and discrete manufacturing industries.

During my nearly 15-year tenure at **AVEVA** (a Schneider Electric company), I served as **Principal Architect and Head of the Presales Team** for Greater China. I was instrumental in establishing AVEVA NET as the #1 digital handover brand in the country and drove the adoption of digital twin technologies in landmark projects across oil & gas, chemicals, power, and new energy sectors. My leadership has directly contributed to creating industry benchmarks and fostering a mature digital ecosystem in China.
